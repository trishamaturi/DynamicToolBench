            "description": "This call will grab a map of all of the games a player has played in the season.     \nplayerID is a required parameter.\nYou can also use gameID if you want to only pull back a specific game. \nseason is an optional parameter.  Currently only 2022 (last season) and 2023 (this season) are available.  If you do not include season as a parameter, it will return this season's games. \n\nExample:\nCorrect way to get the stats for Nikola Vucevic for his game against the Heat on 10/19/2022 would be this:\n/getNBAGamesForPlayer?playerID=28268405032&gameID=20221019_CHI@MIA\n\nBut if you wanted to get all of his games this season, you'd make this call\n/getNBAGamesForPlayer?playerID=28268405032\n\nIf you want his games from last season, do this..\n/getNBAGamesForPlayer?playerID=28268405032&season=2022\n\nBut if you wanted to get all of his games this season, you don't have to include the season. Simply make this call\n/getNBAGamesForPlayer?playerID=28268405032\n\nYou can limit the amount of games returned with parameter: numberOfGames.   For example: &numberOfGames=5 will return the last 5 games this player has an entry for.\n\nThis call will not work without playerID.  If you want stats for all players during a game, then use the getNBABoxScore call with that specific gameID.\n\nThis endpoint also will give the fantasy points for each game if you choose fantasyPoints=true in the inbound payload.  \n\nEach stat has a default for points, but you can input your own league's scoring system using parameters.   Any variable that you leave empty or don't include in the call will use the default scoring.  To remove the default score for that stat, simply change the point value for that stat to 0. (zero)\n\nDefault scoring: 1pt - Point,  1.25 - Rebound, 3 -Steal, 3 - Block, 1.5 -Assist, -1 - Turnover, 0 -Minute\n0pts are default for double doubles, triple doubles, and quad doubles.\nThese categories stack. For instance, if James Harden has a triple double and you gave 3 points for a double double and 5 points for a triple double, then his total bonus will be 8 points. \nStats that count for doubles are pts,blk,stl,reb,ast.\n\nPlease see example for proper usage.",

The stats retrieved here are what are normally shown in box scores or used in fantasy games.  If there are any stats here that you'd like to see, please message us.  \n\nThis does retrieve live stats, however please keep in mind that NBA games tend to begin about 10 minutes later than their official start time.  This can be even longer for nationally televised games.  So if you are looking for live stats of a game that starts at 7, and you don't see anything even at 7:10, don't worry.  It will show up almost immediately after the game starts.    \n\nThe call looks like this /getNBABoxScore?gameID=20220310_BKN@PHI\n\nThe call needs to be exactly in the same format as above.  8 digit date, underscore, then the away team abbreviation, @, then home team abbreviation.  Complete list of team abbreviations can be retrieved with the getNBATeams call or various other calls.  \n\nBut, the best way to find specific game ID's are either from the \"getNBAGamesForDate\" call, or the \"getNBATeamSchedule\" call.\n\nThis also will calculate fantasy scores for each player in the \"playerStats\" map if you set fantasyPoints to \"true\". \n\nEach stat has a default for points, but you can input your own league's scoring system using parameters.   Each player will have a \"fantasyPoints\" element which will use the scoring system you enter or default. Any variable that you leave empty or don't include in the call will use the default scoring.  To remove the default score for that stat, simply change the point value for that stat to 0. (zero)\n\nDefault scoring: 1pt - Point,  1.25 - Rebound, 3 -Steal, 3 - Block, 1.5 -Assist, -1 - Turnover, 0 -Minute\n0pts are default for double doubles, triple doubles, and quad doubles.\nThese categories stack.
