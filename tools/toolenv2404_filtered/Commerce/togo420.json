    "tool_description": "Our Cannabis API is built both for efficiency and simplicity. At togo420.com/apidocs, we have taken a complex ordering process and reduced the number of API endpoints needed to submit an order down to just 3 API endpoints(ie: Create Order, Add Product, and Submit Order). Thus, decreasing the time software developers need to navigate the complex tax structures, cannabis laws, and industry trends inherent to the cannabis business space.\n\nThe end result is a Fully-Automated Direct-to-Consumer platform for ordering cannabis products. Delivering products into the hands of the consumer in a timely manner is our number one priority, usually aiming for delivery within 30 minutes. In addition, our entire supply chain consists of vendors licensed to fulfill deliveries on behalf of our API clients to end-users, the consumers.",
