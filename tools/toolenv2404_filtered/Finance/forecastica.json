            "description": "The Forecastica stock forecasts API utilizes AI and our proprietary machine learning and neural network algorithm to generate 30 day stock forecasts for roughly 200,000 stock symbols that belong to 92 of the most well-known exchanges in the world that span the United States (around 15,000 symbols in total for NYSE, NASDAQ), Europe and Asia.  Each forecast includes open, close, low and high stock prices.   In addition, each forecast include a fap value which is the moving average of the forecasted open, close, low and high price.  The fapPct is a percentage value that represents a predicted percentage change that shows the stock price movement in the predicted stock price calculated based on the forecasted stock price from a given day as compared to the next day stock price forecast ( (day 1 stock price forecast - day 2 stock forecast ) / day 1 stock price forecast).  In addition, each forecasting day includes a BUY, HOLD and SELL trading signal that is based on our proprietary machine learning trading algorithm.  Our trading signal is based on mathematically predicted turning points (relative minimum or maximum value of stock quotes vs. time)\n\nOur proprietary AI/ML model is based on machine learning and neural networks. Simply put, our stock forecasts are driven by pattern recognition that enables the model to identify stock-purchasing trends. It then provides an objective recommendation on what action to take with any given stock!\n\nOur software will help you to hear the pulse of the stock market and get recommendations for the best BUY/SELL/HOLD moments!\n\nThe currency for stock price forecasts are in the local currency of the given exchange specifically the FOREX currency code for the exchange returned in the /api/exchanges endpoint.\n\nIf you get zero results for the given stock symbol use the /exchanges/{EXCHANGE-SYMBOL}/stocks API to lookup the symbol for the given exchange because the symbol may have changed over time as a result you will need query through some of the stock symbols for the given company and try each of their symbols to find out which one is the current stock symbol and data will be returned for the current stock symbol.",
