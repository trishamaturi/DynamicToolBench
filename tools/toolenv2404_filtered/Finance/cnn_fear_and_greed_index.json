            "description": "The SymbolSearchAPI offers a stock symbol lookup service, allowing users to retrieve company information associated with a given stock symbol. It accepts a stock symbol as input and returns a list of data containing company names, match scores, and stock symbols. This service is designed for investors, analysts, and financial technology applications, aiding them in quickly identifying company information related to specific stock symbols.\n\n**Example Use Case Explanation**\n\nWhen users wish to query company information related to a specific stock symbol, they can make an HTTP GET request to the endpoint /cnn/v1/symbol_search/<string:symbol>, where <string:symbol> is the stock symbol they are interested in. For instance, if a user is interested in the stock symbol \"TS\", they would send a request to /cnn/v1/symbol_search/TS.\n\nThis request triggers the symbol_search function, which calls the stock.get_search_symbol(symbol) method to retrieve data associated with that stock symbol. The function then returns a JSON response containing a data key, which is a list of objects. Each object contains companyName (the name of the company), score (the score of the match with the query), and symbol (the stock symbol).\n\nThis API response allows users to quickly identify companies related to a specific stock symbol and sort them by score, where a higher score indicates a higher degree of match with the query. This is particularly useful for users who need to quickly filter and evaluate stock options.",

It is designed to accept a stock symbol and a time range as inputs, returning comprehensive data including the instrument's performance, price changes, market status, and volume, among other key financial indicators. The API supports a wide range of time intervals for reporting, including 1 Day (1D), 5 Days (5D), 10 Days (10D), 1 Month (1M), 3 Months (3M), 6 Months (6M), Year To Date (YTD), 1 Year (1Y), 3 Years (3Y), 5 Years (5Y), 10 Years (10Y), and All-Time (ALL), allowing users to tailor their queries to specific time frames.\n\nThis API is particularly useful for financial analysts, investors, and market researchers who require detailed historical performance data of stocks or other financial instruments to make informed decisions. By providing a comprehensive set of data points for each instrument, including closing price, high and low of the current day, 52-week high and low, volume, and percentage changes, the API facilitates a deep analysis of market trends and instrument performance over time.\n\n**Example Use Case Explanation**\nFor example, when a user wants to get a report on Apple Inc. (AAPL) for a 1-day period, they would send an HTTP GET request to /cnn/v1/instruments_report/AAPL/1D. The request is processed by the get_instruments_report function, which first ensures the specified range is valid by checking against predefined valid values. If the range is invalid, the API returns a JSON error message with HTTP status 400, listing the valid range values.\n\nUpon receiving a valid request, the API fetches data corresponding to the specified symbol and range from a stock information provider. The response includes detailed information such as the call symbol, close price, high and low prices for the current day, 52-week high and low prices, current price, volume, and other relevant data points. Each piece of data is aimed at providing users with a comprehensive overview of the instrument's performance for the specified period.",
