Unfortunately, I realized the workings of the crypto market too late. I have always been skeptical about what I put my money into but I guess these guys were too good because they had documents to back each claim and that made them look legitimate at first.\n\nAfter my recent research about crypto, I think it\u2019s much better to buy and hold in your wallet instead of investing with any platform that might claim to be either trading your assets or mining them for profits because as it currently stands I don\u2019t think there\u2019s still any real trading platform out there, I\u2019m speaking from personal experiences with 2 separate platforms that claimed to be legitimate but at the end all turned out to be fake, I have totally given up in any online investment, Losing your hard-earned money to a virtual investment can really drive one nut if not carefully handled, I can now say I\u2019ve seen it all and I know all the petty tricks they use to lure people into believing them and investing a huge sum, thanks to Digital Web Recovery I got involved with after I learned about the company being a fraudulent company. Altogether I lost a total of about 580,000 Euros to a fake investment platform, the good part of it all was that they didn\u2019t get away with all of it, My research on how to get my funds back turned out to be helpful after getting in touch with Digital Web Recovery, I did everything possible making sure that the recovery team had every resource needed to retrieve my money back to my wallet.\n\nIf you ever come across this before. I can vouch for digital web recovery to be able to assist you with any crypto-related issues.
