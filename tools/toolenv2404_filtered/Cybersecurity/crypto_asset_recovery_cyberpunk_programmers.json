            "description": "My old aunt was contacted via text message by a person claiming to be \u201cJiahao.\u201d Over several months, following Jiahao\u2019s instructions, she purchased crypto assets on an exchange and transferred them to Vexjex.cc where Jiahao claimed they would trade crypto assets for a profit. At some point, my aunt was contacted by the website, which claimed that another person deposited money into the her account, so it froze her account as it appeared to involve money laundering. In order to unfreeze the account, the website instructed my poor aunt to deposit another $450,000. After that, she was unable to access any of her funds which had amounted to more than $1.5 million. Three weeks later, the website is no longer in operation and that\u2019s when she opened up to me for help since I\u2019m in the tech industry. My friend recommended CyberPunk Programmers,  an organization that helps scam victims to recover their funds. I did my research beforehand and found that they have been doing a good job at it over the years, I got their contact email from their website (cyberpunkers . org) and they were so keen with the case. All told, they only needed 2 days to complete the entire transfer of $1.5 million back\u00a0to\u00a0my\u00a0aunt.",
