            "description": "Email is one of the most underrated customer engagement channels. Many email marketers, sales professionals and customer care teams struggle with the quality of their customer email ids. As a result, businesses are losing sales and marketing opportunities. \n\nOne of the common reasons is the poor email validation check during account signup or lead generation stage. Many form validation methods only check the syntax of the email address. But, email verification requires more than a syntax check. \n\nOur Email Verification API is designed to render fast and straightforward email verification checks.\n\nThe API provides the following validation:\n\n- Full standard compliance syntax check\n- Full domain part check, including mail servers configuration check\n- Checking against knowing abusive email domains and accounts list\n- Check if the email address is disposable or not\n \n\nYou can learn more about our process and get a deeper understanding of email verification methods in our blog post - [Deep dive into the real-time email address verification process and why we decided to do it differently?](https://www.bigdatacloud.com/blog/deep-dive-into-the-real-time-email-address-verification-process)",
