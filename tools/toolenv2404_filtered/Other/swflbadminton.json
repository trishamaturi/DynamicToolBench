            "description": "There are not many types of equipment needed to play badminton, and the price is not expensive, so many people will always have a beat at home. However, the selection and preservation of equipment are very knowledgeable.   \u3000\u3000\u25cf Badminton is divided into two kinds of indoor and outdoor For ordinary lovers, a birdie of 20-40 dollars is enough. But many people do not know that the same price of the birdie is also divided into indoor and outdoor types.   \u3000\u3000Most of the birdies we use in our homes are outdoor birdies. The base of this birdie is made of red rubber and can be played without too much force. The regular game birdies are white-headed indoor badminton. The bottom of this birdie is softwood, outsourcing white sheepskin, suitable for indoor competition. Another kind of all-plastic badminton is also very popular, but it is less elastic. It is recommended that readers who want to learn real skills should not use such badminton.   \u3000\u3000The quality of the badminton shoe determines the elasticity of the birdie. If it is an outdoor birdie, then the rubber must be thin and even and tightly bonded. If it is an outdoor birdie, the wood should be soft, and the sheepskin should be densely packed.   \u3000\u3000The 16 feathers on the badminton determine whether it can fly smoothly. The best feathers should be hard, straight, and durable goose feathers, which fall in the most consistent standard. Chickens, ducks, quail crickets, thin wall, it is easy to bend and deformation, so the quality is not guaranteed. The length of the feathers should be between 60-70mm and evenly spaced, with the same thickness. There should be no problems such as falling hair, broken stems, insects, etc.. Otherwise the birdie will not follow the right path.   \u3000\u3000\u25cf The racket is too light and bad. There are many kinds of rackets available on the market. Prices range from tens of dollars to a few hundred dollars and a few thousand dollars. I suggest that beginners purchase 100-200 brand rackets for practice. More than 30 yuan beat cannot beat, but it is hard texture, not how long it can easily be broken.   \u3000\u3000Some people think that the lighter the tempo, the higher the materials used. In fact, an overly burdensome racquet can cause strain on the muscles and is not conducive to exercise. However, if the tempo is too light, it will not be firm enough, and it will severely affect the impact. Therefore, a racket that is too light is not good.   \u3000\u3000When you take a picture, you should shake it to see if it can't shake hands. The tempo that feels a shocked hand is usually too hard to shoot the racket and head and the elasticity is weak, which is not conducive to exercise.  \u3000\u3000There are significant and small handles. When you choose, you have to hold your hand to feel comfortable. In general, a person with a large hand will feel uncomfortable carrying a relatively thin or square handle; a person with a small hand will not be commensurate with a large handle. Finally, check the head for deformation, cracks, or overall bending.   \u3000\u3000\u25cf Do not make strings too tight. Advanced rackets generally do not wind up beforehand. This requires a person who buys a racket to prepare a string with appropriate texture and tightness according to his or her movements.   \u3000\u3000Beating strings from the texture points, generally sheep string, nylon string, beef string and chemical fiber sheep intestinal synthesis string four. Sheep string has good elasticity, but it is easy to break. The nylon string is beautiful, but its flexibility is reduced. It is affected by the temperature, and it is brittle in winter. The beef tendon is healthy, and the price is low, but its elasticity is reduced. Synthetic chord synthesis is a type that is used by professional players in the current competition. It is firm, flexible, and flexible. However, due to the complicated production process, it is expensive.   \u3000\u3000The number of pounds to be drawn should vary according to different conditions. The professional team members use a high number of pounds and a very tight racquet, so the speed of returning the birdie is very fast, and the technical requirements are high. For ordinary badminton enthusiasts, the beats need to be a little elastic and do not need to be so tight, 18-22 pounds is enough. If you are an enthusiast of offensive style, you need to take a little bit of a chord; the defensive style lovers may be a bit looser.",
