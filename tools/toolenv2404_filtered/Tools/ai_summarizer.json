It\u2019s a reaction of discomfort, not cruelty; you made it weird. You don\u2019t know why you feel the need to shame your own body in front of a stranger, but you blame it on her lululemon leggings and air-hostess smile. She makes you nervous. Most people do. When you go outside, sit next to a man on a bus bench. He\u2019s reading a book, and you recognize the cover from an English course in college. A man\u2019s body, clad in red, knight-like armour, with a white mask where his head should be. The mask is smiling and handsome on one side, twisted and snarling on the other, with a hollow void where his eyes should be. The Mysterious Stranger, by Mark Twain. Good taste. When you sit, notice how the man\u2019s eyes dash over in your direction. It\u2019s almost imperceptible, and no other part of him moves an inch. Convince yourself that the chill trickling down your spine is a sign of an early winter wind. The sweat beneath your arms says differently. Change into your new shoes right there on the bench. They\u2019re tight, but almost comforting, reminding you of the cattle squeeze chutes on the farm you grew up on. Your new shoes are white, because white seemed luxurious and fresh and symbolic (new beginnings, clean slate). Now, curse and rub your own spit into a dirt smudge on the side. Remember that white is rarely ever white at all\u2014think of the stains spreading like mould along shower walls."
