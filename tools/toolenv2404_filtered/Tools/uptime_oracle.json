            "description": "The getStatus endpoint is a pivotal feature for real-time monitoring of online resources. It accepts a single parameter, 'url', which represents the website to be checked. Users can input any URL they wish to monitor, and the endpoint will process this request to determine the current status of the specified website.\n\nUpon a successful operation, getStatus returns a structured and informative JSON response. This response includes three key pieces of information: statusCode, statusMessage, and isDown. The statusCode is a numerical value indicating the HTTP response code received from the website, such as 200 for a successful connection. The statusMessage provides a textual representation of this status code, like \"200 OK\" for a standard successful response. Lastly, the isDown field is a boolean indicator, which is false when the website is operational and true if the website is not responding or is inaccessible.",
