A shipping functionality is an additional characteristic or 'add on' service that defines one shipping method from another. Some functionalities are related to the form of the shipment that's accepted for shipment, such as letterbox, parcel or pallet, while other functionalities specify any additional handling that's required, such as Age check or Signature required. Functionalities can also denote specific delivery deadlines or weekend delivery availability. \n\n<!-- theme: info -->\n\n>The below **Glossary of shipping functionalities** provides a description of every possible shipping functionality associated with a Sendcloud-supported shipping method.\n\nShipping functionality             | Description\n------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n`age_check`             | Indicates whether the recipient must be above a certain age (e.g., to accept alcohol products).\n`b2b`                   | Indicates whether the shipment is a b2b shipment.\n`b2c`                   | Indicates whether the shipment is a b2c shipment.\n`boxable`               | Indicates whether the shipment fits in a box.\n`bulky_goods`           | Indicates whether the shipment is bulky, e.g. it does not fit in a box.\n`carrier_billing_type`  | Indicates whether the shipment is billed on a country to country basis, or based on a shipping zone to shipping zone.
