You can use this endpoint to find a specific shipping method `id`, which you can then specify in your request to [Create a parcel](paths/~1parcels/post). \n\nIf a shipping method `id` value is present, and if the `request_label` parameter has the value `true`, then a shipping label is created and the parcel is announced. \n\nThe shipping methods returned are based on the following factors:\n1. The carriers you have <a href=\"Getting-started\">**enabled**</a> in your Sendcloud account; \n2. (Optional) The direct <a href=\"Contracts\">**carrier contracts**</a> you have connected; and,\n3. Your <a href=\"sender-addresses\">**sender address**</a>\n\n<!-- theme: info -->\n\n>**Tip:** Via this endpoint you can only retrieve shipping methods based on three parameters: `sender_address`, `service_point_id` and `is_return`. If you need to filter the results because yourequire a method which contains a specific shipping functionality or other criteria, you can refer to the <a href=\"Get-shipping-products\">**Get shipping products**</a> endpoint. \n\n---\n\n### Specifying a sender address\n\nYou can have multiple sender addresses stored in your Sendcloud account. This endpoint will return the shipping methods associated with your **default** sender address, **unless** you provide a specific `sender_adress` `id`. \n\n<!-- theme: info -->\n\n> **Tip:** You can find the `id` for each of your sender addresses via the <a href=\"get-a-single-sender-address\">**Get a single sender address**</a> endpoint.\n\n### Use case\n\nFor example, your default sender address may be based in the Netherlands, but you have a second sender address based in Austria. If you don't specify a `sender_address` `id`, this endpoint will **only** return shipping methods applicable for shipments from the Netherlands. \n\nTo see shipping methods applicable for Austria, e.g. from DPD Austria, specify the `id` for your Austrian sender address in the HTTP request. The retrieved results will now include carriers such as Post AT, DPD Austria, etc, depending on your <a href=\"enabling-carriers\">enabled carriers</a>). \n\n**Example:** \n\n<span style=\"background-color: #1D97FF\">GET</span> `https://panel.sendcloud.sc/api/v2/shipping_methods?sender_address={ID}`\n\n\n---\n\n### Use cases\n\n- **Find a service point delivery shipping method**\n\nIf you want to retrieve a list of shipping methods which are applicable for **service point delivery**, provide a `service_point_id` in the request. You can find an appropriate `service_point_id` via the <a href=\"Service-points-api\">**Service Points API**</a>. \n\n\n- **Find a suitable shipping method for a return**\n\nReturn shipping methods are treated differently than methods for outgoing parcels. If you want to filter the results to show only the methods which you can apply to return parcels, include the argument `is_return: \"true\"`. \n\n- **Invalid shipment ID Error message**\nIf you try to <a ref=\"Create-a-parcel\">**Create a parcel**</a> but receive the error message \"Invalid shipment id\", this could be because the specified `id` relates to a shipping method which is not possible for the given destination address. \n\nFor example, if you need to ship a parcel internationally but the specific shipping method only supports national (domestic) shipping, then you would need to lookup a new shipping method `id` which supports method of delivery and change the request.",
